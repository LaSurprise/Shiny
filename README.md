## Our First Shiny Application : "ShinyTest_StormData"

The goal of this work was to develop and document a shiny application.
In order to reach this goal, we used data from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database.  
We specially worked with data from 1950 to 2011. 
 
With this application, you can display the most harmful events or the trend since 1950.  
You can also choose outcome to display : fatalities, injuries, economic cost.  

Some features have been added just to manipulate sliders and others kind of input.

## Visualize Slides : Option 2

1. Fork the repo on your computer
 : a directory named Shiny will be created with all files used in this project      
2. Open an run Doc.Rmd with RStudio
