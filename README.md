## Our First shiny Application : "ShinyTest_StormData"

  
Tha goal of this work was to develop and document a shiny application.
In order to reach this goal, we used data from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database.  
We specially worked with data from 1950 to 2011. 
 
With this application, you can display the most harmful events or the trend since 1950.  
You can also choose outcome to display : fatalities, injuries, economic cost.  

Some features are added just to manipulate sliders and others kind of input.  

Shiny Apllication has two parts : ui.R and server.R files  

Doc.md explains what you need to do so that everything will be OK

Test were perfect with RStudio.
